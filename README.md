Gigabots Dashboard
------------------

The Gigabots Dashboard allows you to control a Gigabot in real-time and create custom behaviors using Block based programming.  


If you just want to use your Gigabot and aren't developing features for the Gigabots Dashboard, you probably want to head over to [The Gigabots Website](https://www.thegigabots.com) and click the link to the live dashboard.
